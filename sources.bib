	abstract = {This paper is the second part of the new evaluation of atomic masses, {AME}2016. Using least-squares adjustments to all evaluated and accepted experimental data, described in Part I, we derive tables with numerical values and graphs to replace those given in {AME}2012. The first table lists the recommended atomic mass values and their uncertainties. It is followed by a table of the influences of data on primary nuclides, a table of various reaction and decay energies, and finally, a series of graphs of separation and decay energies. The last section of this paper lists all references of the input data used in the {AME}2016 and the {NUBASE}2016 evaluations (first paper in this issue). {AMDC}: http://amdc.impcas.ac.cn/ Contents The {AME}2016 atomic mass evaluation ({II}).

	isbn = {978-3-642-76356-4},
	abstract = {Two decades ago, with the introduction of Skyrme forces [2.1], Hartree—Fock calculations became feasible in nuclear physics. Since then, they have been applied to a great variety of phenomena, including deformation properties, superheavy nuclei, vibrations, and heavy-ion collisions [2.2]. Nonetheless, their most straightforward application, the description of the ground state of spherical nuclei, remains a useful tool. It serves as the basis for many further applications in nuclear-structure physics; e.g., for studying refinements and variants of the force [2.3], for understanding electron-scattering data, for describing hyperons in nuclei, or for {RPA} vibrations of the ground-state. Thus, it is desirable to have a code optimized for speed. Such a code also provides a good example of the fast numerical techniques that are necessary for large scale applications.},

	shorttitle = {Skyrme-force parametrization},
	abstract = {We investigate systematically the possibilities and the limits of the Skyrme force for reproducing nuclear ground-state properties in a spherical Hartree-Fock calculation. This investigation is performed by means of least-squares fits of the force parameters to the measured binding energy, diffraction radius, and surface width of eight selected nuclei. Particular emphasis is put on the density dependence of the interaction, which turns out to be determined mainly by the surface width. The least-squares fitting procedure yields the best-fit parameters together with uncertainties on them, and it also allows one to estimate the uncertainties of an extrapolation to other fields, e.g., nuclear matter properties. We also study the contribution of random-phase-approximation correlations to the ground-state properties and their influence on the parameters of the effective interaction. Here, we also compare to giant dipole resonance energies.},

	abstract = {A set of 799 ground state nuclear charge radii is presented. Experimental data from elastic electron scattering, muonic atom X-rays, Kα isotope shifts, and optical isotope shifts have been taken into account that were available up to January 2004. Wherever possible, connections and constraints between the data were applied to make the data system consistent. Based on the resulting data set, the smooth global structure of the radius surface R(N,Z) was investigated by fitting simple empirical functions to the intersections with constant Z and N as well as with constant A plains. The simple behavior of the surface rendered it possible to apply a simple model, the two-liquid drop model to reproduce the main tendencies, and to predict the existence of a indentation along the line of stability on the radius surface. This indentation suggests a decrease of average nucleon density away from stability. The fine structure in the mass number dependence of rms charge radii is briefly presented.},

Data on charge distributions obtained on the basis of a phenomenological model—parameters of nuclei and differences therein between isotopes and between other neighboring nuclei like isotones—are given in Tables I, {II}, and {III}. Parameters obtained by a model-independent analysis are given in two additional tables: Table {IV} gives the coefficients of a Fourier-Bessel series expansion, and Table V gives the positions and amplitudes for the expansion in a sum of gaussians. References through February 1986 have been covered.},
